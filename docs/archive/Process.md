## Suggestion

Ideas are added as to the `Suggestions` column by any team member. They can come from the project Discord, the official Discord, the official suggestions subreddit, the official forums or the team member themselves. Brief detail about the idea should be added to the card description.

Team members can vote on the cards to mark their approval or assign themselves as a member of the card to indicate that they have a problem with it. Discussion of the card should take place in its comments. It will be advanced to `Approved` once the product owner is satisfied.

## Approved

Once the product owner (Stylingirl) is herself happy with with an idea and convinced that it has enough support she will advance it to `Approved` and remove all card members from it.

At this point any team member may choose to start work on the card to advance it to `In Progress`.

## In Progress

If a team member starts work on a card the assign themselves as a member of the card and advance it to `In Progress`. It will stay here as long as they are working on it. Checklists on the card can be used at this stage to track outstanding workitems and progress towards completion.

Once work is complete on a card it will be advanced to either `Ready For Merge` (if it was simple enough not to require a second eye) or `Testing` (otherwise).

## Testing

Cards placed in `Testing` are complete as far as the development work goes but either require more time or additional attention to be sure the idea is ready to integrate. Comments should indicate why the card is here.

The card owner may move the card to `Ready For Merge` when they feel it is ready.

## Ready For Merge

Cards in `Ready For Merge` are complete and have a pull request ready for the release manager (Chard) to integrate them in the master repository.

Once he does this he will move the card on to `Done` indicating that it will appear in the next release.

## Done

The final column, `Done`, tracks work that will appear in an upcoming release.
