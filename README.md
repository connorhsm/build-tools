# build-tools

## History
This repository originated from [Chard Bury](https://github.com/chardbury), originally created to house proccesses and scripts to manage the Community Crucible fork of OneLife, this is intended to be our moditication of those tools. An archive of the repository, close to the state Chard had left it in before Community Crucible was deleted, can be found at https://github.com/twohoursonelife/archive-build-tools.

## Current
At this time, I am working through these scripts again with the goal of modularising them more and converting them to work with our setup.

All components of this repository are unstable and should not be relied upon at this time.
